# Capstone-Project

This repository contains my capstone project for the Codecademy "Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist Career Path" Certificate Program. It represents an opportunity to put all that I have learned together to present my new Data Analysis skills. The project is largely freeform in order to allow for the demonstration of the Data Analysis workflow learned through the career path program. Below I have laid out my steps to completion:

Data Retrieval:

In order to locate data I navigated to Kaggle and searched through their "Creative Commons" datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?license=cc) in order to find a datset that would interest me and provide an opportunity to work through a dataset and highlight the way I am able to think about, work through and visualize my results while finding actionable information from the data.

In the end, I decided to pick the following dataset:
Top 50 Bestselling Novels 2009 - 2021 of Amazon - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zwl1234/top-50-bestselling-novels-20092021-of-amazon
